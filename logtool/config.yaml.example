# Remote Server Connection
# This tool uses SSH to access and download logs
server:
  host: "your_server_ip"
  user: "your_username"
  port: 22
  ssh_key_path: "/path/to/private/key"
  # Optional: only if your key has a passphrase
  # ssh_passphrase: "your_passphrase"

logs:
  # Directory on the remote server where logs are stored
  remote_path: "/www/var/chatbot/backend/logs"
  
  # Local directory to save downloaded logs
  # The script will create subfolders for each day/run if needed, or flat structure.
  # Let's keep it flat for now based on request.
  local_path: "logs"
  
  # File patterns to target
  # We want to download anything ending in .1.log, .2.log, etc.
  # And ignore the active .log file.
  import_patterns:
    - "*.log.1"
    - "*.log.2"
    - "*.log.3"
    - "*.log.4"
    - "*.log.5"
    # Add more if needed, or the script can use regex for *.[0-9]+.log

settings:
  # Action after download: 'delete' or 'keep'
  # Based on user request: "Chỉ giữ lại .log" implies deleting rotated logs from server.
  # WARNING: Setting this to 'delete' will remove files from the server!
  after_download: "delete"
